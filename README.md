A Unity Game created for my Advanced Game Design class. It's a turn-based roguelike where the idea was to build on a system of scaling modifiers that could get so high the game theoretically broke.

Vamplify was a lot of fun to make but also probably the most difficult project I had ever taken on. I spent an immense amount of time creating its underlying systems which also in some ways backfired on me. The underlying game had some areas that could be considered undercooked. There was also a hanging bug where data was not clearing properly on restart. I know this is likely due to a hanging singleton but I did not have the time to fix it unfortunately. There's a lot of things where this game would have gone from good to great if I had a bit more time.
However, there is a lot that I am very happy with. The grid-based movement and pathfinding are fast and very effective. The way attacks calculate is really solidly built in my opinion, and can handle a large number of unique scenarios. Finally, the modifier system is robust and allowed for extremely quick iteration once I actually got it working.

Overall, I'm happy with the project.
